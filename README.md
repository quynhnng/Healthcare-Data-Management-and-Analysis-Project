The objective of this project is to predict patient readmission rates within a hospital setting. The healthcare industry often struggles with high patient readmission rates which might imply a lack of patient care and increasing healthcare costs. This project will require data collecting, cleaning and analysis to create a predictive model that can identify patients at risk of readmission.
